RELEASE_NOTES

Enea LINX for Linux
-------------------

Version: 2.6.9
--------------

This is a release of Enea LINX for Linux, containing
the LINX kernel module, LINX Ethernet Connection Manager (CM) module,
LINX TCP CM module, LINX shared memory CM module, the LINX RapidIO CM module,
CMCL module, the LINX library, tools for supervising and for configuring
inter-node communication and the LINX Gateway server.


Main Changes
------------

In order to speed up the allocation and freeing from the pool, two new kernel
module parameters have been added (linx_pool_s_alloc_count and 
linx_pool_s_free_count). For more information check chapter 7 from LINX for 
Linux User's Guide.

No new Connection Managers added.

3.18.21-031821-generic x86_64
3.18.22-031822-generic x86_64
3.19.0-15-generic x86_64
4.1.6-040106-generic x86_64
4.2.0-27-generic x86_64
4.4.12 x86_64
4.4.68-040468-generic

4.8.17-040817-generic x86_64
4.9.2-040902-generic x86_64
4.13.0-16-generic x86_64
4.15.0-20-generic x86_64
4.18.0-10-generic x86_64
4.19.0-041900-generic x86_64,

CentOS kernels:
2.6.18-406.el5
2.6.32-504.el6.x86_64
2.6.32-642.el6.i686
3.10.0-327.el7.x86_64
3.10.0-514.16.1.el7.x86_64
3.10.0-957.5.1.el7.x86_64.
Backward compatibility for LINX version 2.6.8 was not affected. Vendor specific
kernels may require modifications in the LINX source code.


LINX Development Environment Requirements
-----------------------------------------

LINX does not use any unusual features and should be easy to build in any
modern self hosted or cross build environment.


LINX Known Bugs and Limitations
-------------------------------

Once a connection has been setup on an Ethernet interface, the interface's
MTU, address and name must not be changed (e.g. ifconfig eth1 mtu 1000). If
the LINX Ethernet CM detects such a change, it prints an error message to
the kernel ring buffer. Note that from now on, the behaviour of the affected
connections are unpredictable, e.g. signals may be truncated, etc. The only
way to ensure correct behaviour is to re-create the affected connections.

From one Ethernet interface, it is not possible to create multiple connections
to the same destination address. Same applies to TCP/IP CM (IP address instead
of MAC address etc.).

Some kernel versions and distributions require that LINX is built with
LINX_KERNEL_WORKAROUND_1 flag set to yes, see README.

The make system lacks proper dependencies.

If the LINXDISC daemon is killed with SIGKILL, it cannot be restarted due to
lack of cleanup. However, if the user removes the lockfile and established
LINX-connections, the daemon may be started again.

The "con_cookie" field is wrongly printed in /proc/net/linx/ files starting
with kernel version 4.15.

Shell command linxcfg hangs on kernel version 2.6.18 if signal pool feature 
is deactivated.
